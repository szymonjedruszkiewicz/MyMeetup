# MyMeetup

My (very basic) take on Meetup-like application.

Functionalities implemented: 
- registration / login
- adding event
- modifying event (admin role only)
- posting comment
- searching events 
- declaring participation in given event
- REST endpoint

I used Spring (Boot, Data, Security) + Thymeleaf/Bootstrap + MySql. FlyWay took care of database schema as well as inserting some data into it.

App is deployed on Heroku.
